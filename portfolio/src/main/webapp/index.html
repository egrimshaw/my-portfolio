      <h1>Welcome to Evie's Portfolio!</h1>
      <p><img id = "profilePic" src = "/images/ProfileImage.jpg" alt = "Evie's profile picture"></p>
      <p> I was born in London, but moved to Boston, MA when my mom remarried. 
          I have six siblings (I am the fifth child), so it is always a bit crazy in our house. 
          Currently, I am a rising junior at Brown University and study
          Computer Science and Economics. Outside of classes, I am the chair of the on-campus
          business education committee for Women in Business and I love to exercise. I am beyond
          excited to work on the ASA team and at Google this summer (even if we are remote)!
