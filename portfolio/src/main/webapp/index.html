      <p class = "welcomeText"> Hi! My name is Evie Grimshaw. I was born in London, but moved to Boston when my mom remarried. 
          I have six siblings (I am the fifth child), so it is always a bit crazy in our house. 
          Currently, I am a rising junior at Brown University and studying
          Computer Science and Economics. Outside of classes, I am the chair of the on-campus
          business education committee for Women in Business, and I love to exercise. I am beyond
          excited to work on the ASA team and at Google this summer (even if we are remote)!
