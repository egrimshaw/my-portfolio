        This quote is my family's motto. I was born in London and there, I was the youngest of four, the Grimshaws. In
        the US, my step-father had two children, the Chungs. When my mother got remarried, we moved to Boston and
        combined our two families and added on another child, CC. All together, there are seven of us, a mix of Asian,
        American, and British. We may not all look alike, but side by side, we create the Chungshaws.
