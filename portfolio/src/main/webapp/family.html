        <p><q>Blood doesn't make someone family. Love is what makes a family.</q> -Nichole Chase </p>
        <p> This quote is my family's motto. I was born in London and there, I was the youngest of 
            four, the Grimshaws. In the US, my step-father had two children, the Chungs. When my mother got remarried,
            we moved to Boston and combined our two families and added on another child, CC. All together, there 
            are seven of us, a mix of Asian, American, and British. We may not all look alike, but side
            by side, we create the Chungshaws.
